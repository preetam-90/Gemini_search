# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on setting up the initial project structure and core components for the search engine. This includes creating the project brief, product context, and active context files to establish a clear foundation for the project.

## Recent Changes
1. **Project Brief**: Created the project brief to define the core requirements and goals of the project.
2. **Product Context**: Created the product context to outline the problem statement, solution, user experience goals, target audience, competitive analysis, and differentiators.

## Next Steps
1. **System Patterns**: Document the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.
2. **Tech Context**: Document the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.
3. **Progress**: Track the current status of the project, including what works, what's left to build, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions.
4. **Home Page Animation**: Enhance the home page with animations, particles, and other visual enhancements to make it more beautiful in both light and dark modes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Technology Stack**: Decided to use modern web technologies for the frontend and backend, including React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
2. **AI Integration**: Decided to integrate AI models to improve search accuracy and relevance.
3. **Scalability**: Decided to design the system to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing user base and data.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Prefer using a component-based architecture for the frontend to improve reusability and maintainability.
2. **Modular Design**: Prefer using a modular design for the backend to improve scalability and maintainability.
3. **Continuous Integration**: Prefer using continuous integration to automate the build and testing process.

## Learnings and Project Insights
1. **User Feedback**: Learned the importance of user feedback in improving search accuracy and relevance.
2. **Accessibility**: Learned the importance of designing the search engine to be accessible to users with disabilities.
3. **Scalability**: Learned the importance of designing the system to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing user base and data.
