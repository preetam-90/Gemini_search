# Progress

## What Works
1. **Project Brief**: The project brief has been created to define the core requirements and goals of the project.
2. **Product Context**: The product context has been created to outline the problem statement, solution, user experience goals, target audience, competitive analysis, and differentiators.
3. **Active Context**: The active context has been created to track the current focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, considerations, patterns, preferences, and insights.
4. **System Patterns**: The system patterns have been documented to outline the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.
5. **Tech Context**: The tech context has been documented to outline the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.

## What's Left to Build
1. **Search Functionality**: Implement the search functionality using AI models to provide accurate and relevant search results.
2. **User Interface**: Design a clean and intuitive UI for the search engine, including a search bar, results display, and filters.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the system for performance to handle a high volume of queries efficiently.
4. **Testing**: Implement unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the system works as expected.
5. **Deployment**: Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to automate the build and deployment process.
6. **Home Page Animation**: Enhance the home page with animations, particles, and other visual enhancements to make it more beautiful in both light and dark modes.

## Current Status
The project is in the initial stages of development. The core documentation has been created, and the next steps involve implementing the search functionality and designing the user interface.

## Known Issues
1. **Latency**: The system must handle high latency scenarios gracefully.
2. **Scalability**: The system must be able to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing user base.
3. **Security**: The system must comply with data privacy regulations and handle user data securely.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **Technology Stack**: Decided to use modern web technologies for the frontend and backend, including React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
2. **AI Integration**: Decided to integrate AI models to improve search accuracy and relevance.
3. **Scalability**: Decided to design the system to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing user base and data.
