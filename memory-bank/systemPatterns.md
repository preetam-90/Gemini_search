# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The system will be built using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The frontend will be developed using React, and the backend will be developed using Node.js. The AI models will be integrated into the backend to provide search functionality.

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Frontend Framework**: React will be used for the frontend to provide a responsive and interactive user interface.
2. **Backend Framework**: Node.js will be used for the backend to handle server-side logic and API requests.
3. **Database**: A NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) will be used to store search results and user data.
4. **AI Models**: Pre-trained AI models will be integrated into the backend to improve search accuracy and relevance.

## Design Patterns
1. **Component-Based Architecture**: The frontend will use a component-based architecture to improve reusability and maintainability.
2. **Modular Design**: The backend will use a modular design to improve scalability and maintainability.
3. **Singleton Pattern**: The database connection will be implemented using the singleton pattern to ensure a single instance is used throughout the application.

## Component Relationships
1. **Frontend Components**: The frontend will consist of components such as the search bar, results display, and filters.
2. **Backend Services**: The backend will consist of services such as the search service, user service, and AI service.
3. **Database Schema**: The database will consist of collections such as users, search results, and AI models.

## Critical Implementation Paths
1. **Search Functionality**: Implement the search functionality using AI models to provide accurate and relevant search results.
2. **User Interface**: Design a clean and intuitive UI for the search engine, including a search bar, results display, and filters.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the system for performance to handle a high volume of queries efficiently.
